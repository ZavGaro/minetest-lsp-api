# Rules and Tips for devs

- There **must** be an indent between plain text, lists, code, images and other
  various content.
- Code documentation should not have titles! As a last resort, use bold text
  instead.
- If some variable has many features, it is better to format its description as
  a **list** for better readability.
- Try to always start sentences with a capital letter and end with a dot.
- Please attend to variables that can accept `nil` (aka optional). It is highly
  recommended to always note this in the documentation, as well as specify
  their default value.
